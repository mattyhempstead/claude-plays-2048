# Claude Plays 2048

I got Claude to play the game [2048](https://play2048.co/).

Inspired by [Claude Plays Pokemon](https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon).

I forced Claude to play for ~48 hours, with each game taking around 3 hours.

Claude used 1 million input tokens and 2.5 million output tokens, costing me ~$40 USD.

In that time, Claude finished 15 games and the best it did was the 256 tile.

The whole process was streamed on Twitch to around 300 unique viewers.
